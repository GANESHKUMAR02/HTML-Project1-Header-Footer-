                <h2>What is html?</h2>
                <p><li>HTML(HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of
                    all web pages.</li>
                    <li>It provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as
                    images, text, or videos by creating a basic skeleton.</li>
                    <li> HTML is still very useful today, the reason being no matter the
                    framework or language we use to develop the web page, the output
                    would be rendered in HTML.</li></p>

            <h2>HTML Basics</h2>
            <p><li>HTML is a standard defined by the WHATWG, an acronym for Web Hypertext
                Application Technology Working Group, an organization formed by people working
                on the most popular web browser. This means it's basically controlled by Google,
                Mozilla, Apple, and Microsoft.</li>
                <li>In The past the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) was the organization in charge of
                creating the HTML standard.</li>
                <li>The control informally moved from W3C to WHATWG when it became clear that the
                W3C push towards XHTML was not a good idea.</li></p>

            <h2>HTML Versions</h2>
            <p><li>We had HTML version 1 in 1993.</li>
                <li>HTML 2 followed in 1995.</li>
                <li>We got HTML 3 in January 1997, and HTML 4 in December 1997.</li>
                <li>HTML5 is a term that now defines a whole set of technologies, which
                includes HTML but adds a lot of APIs and standards like WebGL, SVG,
                and more</li></p>

            <h2> HTML & Browser</h2>
            <p><li>It can be generated by a server-side application that builds it depending on
                the request or the session data, for example, a Rails or Laravel, or Django
                application.</li>
                <li>It can be generated by a JavaScript client-side application that generates
                HTML on the fly.</li>
                <li>In the simplest case, it can be stored in a file and served to the browser by a
                Web server.</li>

            <h2>HTML Page Structure</h2>
            <p><li>The HTML starting tag is used at the beginning of the document,
                right after the document type declaration.</li>
                <li>The HTML ending tag is the last thing present in an HTML
                document.</li>
                <li>Inside the HTML element we have 2 elements: head and body</li>
                <li>Inside the head, we will have tags that are essential to creating a
                web page, like the title, the metadata, and internal or external
                CSS and JavaScript. Mostly things that do not directly appear on
                the page, but only help the browser (or) bots like the Google
                search bot) display it properly.</li>
                <li>Inside the body we will have the content of the page. The visible stuff.</li>
            </p>

            <h2>Tags vs. Elements</h2>
            <p><li>Elements have a starting tag and a closing tag. In this example, we use the p starting and closing tags to create a p element:</li>
                <p>paragraph of text</p>
                <dl>So, an element constitutes the whole package:</dl>
                <dd>starting tag</dd>
                <dd>text content (and possibly other elements)</dd>
                <dd>closing tag</dd>
                <li>If an element has doesn't have a closing tag, it is only written with the starting tag, and it
                cannot contain any text content.</li></p>

            <h2>Attributes</h2>
            <p> <li>The starting tag of an element can have special snippets of information we can attach,
                called attributes. Attributes have the key="value" syntax:</li>
                <li>The class and id attributes are two of the most common you will find used.
                <li>They have a special meaning, and they are useful both in CSS and JavaScript.
                <li>The difference between the two is that an id is unique in the context of a web page; it
                cannot be duplicated. Classes, on the other hand, can appear multiple times on multiple
                elements.
                <li>Plus, an id is just one value. A class can hold multiple values, separated by a space.

            <h2>Case insensitive</h2>
            <p><li>HTML is case insensitive. Tags can be written in all caps, or lowercase. In the
                early days, caps were the norm. Today lowercase is the norm. It is a
                convention.<br>
                You usually write like this:<br>
                <p>A paragraph of text</p>
                not like this:<br>
                <P>A paragraph of text</P>

            <h2>Link</h2>
            <p><b>What is a hyperlink?</b>
                <li>Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer.</li>
                <li>They've been a feature of the Web since the beginning, and are what makes the Web
                a web. Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to
                specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address.</li>
                <li>Almost any web content can be converted to a link so that when clicked or otherwise
                activated the web browser goes to another web address (URL)
            </li></p>
            <img src="https://www.codegrepper.com/codeimages/how-to-add-image-as-hyperlink-in-html.png" alt="HyperLink">
           
           <p><b>Anatomy of a link</b>
            <li>A basic link is created by wrapping the text or
            other content, inside an element and using
            the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext
            Reference, or target, that contains the web
            address.</li>
            <li>Another attribute you may want to add to your
            links is title. The title contains additional
            information about the link, such as which kind
            of information the page contains, or things to
            be aware of on the website</li>
            <p>
                <b>Block level links</b>.
            <li>Almost any content can be made into a link, even block-level elements. If you have an
                image you want to make into a link, use the element and reference the image file
                with the element.URLs & paths</li>
                <li>A URL, or Uniform Resource Locator is a string of text that defines where something is
                located on the Web.</li>
            <li>URLs use paths to find files. Paths specify where the file you're interested in is located in
                the filesystem.</li>

            <h2>Image</h2>
            <p>
                <li>Images on a web page are created with the tag.</li>
                <li>This tag can add images, icons, photos, and other graphic elements.</li>
                <li>The tag does not have a closing tag it is self-closing.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>HTML alt attribute</b>
                <li>The alt attribute provides an alternate text for the image.</li>
                <li>It should contain a brief description of the image.</li>
                <li>Its value will display when the image cannot be loaded.Screen readers also use this value.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Image size tips</b>
                <li>If you only include width, then height will be calculated in
                    proportion to the original image ratio.</li>
                <li>If you only include height, then width will be calculated in
                    proportion to the original image ratio.</li>
                    <li>If you include both height and width be sure the ratio is the
                        same as the original image, or else the image will appear
                        compressed or stretched in one direction.</li>
                    <li>To reduce page load times use images of the correct size
                        rather than resizing them in the browser with height and
                        width attributes.</li>
